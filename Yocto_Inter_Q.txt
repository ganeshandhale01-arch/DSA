what is yocto & how we can use it for am335x beaglebone board specifiv arch?

What all are steps involved in the yocto to when we run bitbake command for am335x beaglebone board?

In the TI Processor SDK (TISDK) Yocto build for AM335x BeagleBone boards?

4. Fetching Sources
Downloads source tarballs or clones Git repositories (Linux kernel, U-Boot, libraries).
Stores them in DL_DIR.
What is DL_DIR in above step?

5. Unpacking & Patching
Extracts sources into WORKDIR.
Applies Yocto patches (e.g., kernel patches for AM335x board support).
What is WORKDIR in above step?

how you can inspect your patched kernel tree inside WORKDIR during a TISDK Yocto build for AM335x?

you like me to map exactly where your kernel patches slot into the TISDK pipeline (do_patch ? do_compile ? do_deploy) so you can see how your work integrates with TI?s Yocto flow?

Give me to give you a step-by-step minimal working example (commands + layer setup) specifically for BeagleBone Black AM335x? That way you can try it out quickly?

what all are folder & layers in yocto?
